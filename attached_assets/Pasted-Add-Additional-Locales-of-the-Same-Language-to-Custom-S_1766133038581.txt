Add Additional Locales of the Same Language to Custom Skills
 Note: Sign in to the developer console to build or publish your skill.
To expand your customer reach, you can add additional locales of the same language to your custom skill. For example, if you support American English (en_US), you can try to reach customers in different regions by adding UK English (en_GB) and India English (en_IN) locales to your custom skill.

The following sections describe the features you can use to add additional locales of the same language to your custom skill. For conceptual information about how to use multiple locales in your custom skill, see Configure a Skill for Multiple Languages.

About adding additional locales of the same language to your custom skills
You can add additional locales of the same language to your custom skills by using one of the following features:

Sync locales – Automatically duplicates your custom-skill locale assets to additional locales of the same language. When you use this feature, you choose a primary locale and a set of secondary locales. Your locales automatically sync every time you build your primary locale's interaction model or save a manifest change.
Locale clone – Duplicates your custom-skill locale assets to additional locales of the same language. When you use this feature, you choose a primary locale and a set of secondary locales. Cloning occurs after you explicitly choose the clone option in the developer console. This feature doesn't continuously sync your locales automatically.
Automated locale distribution – Automatically publishes existing custom-skill locale assets to other preconfigured locales of the same language without the need for certification.
The following table describes when it might be appropriate for you to use each of these features.

About sync locales
The sync locales feature automatically triggers every time you build your primary locale's interaction model or save a manifest change. After you complete one of these actions, your secondary locales are then updated with your changes.

Sync locales automatically triggers every time you build your primary locale's interaction model or save a manifest change. After you complete one of these actions, your secondary locales are then updated with your changes.

 Important: The sync occurs when you update the interaction model for the primary locale. If you update the model for a secondary locale instead, the changes aren't built. This is because the primary locale always overrides the secondary locales when you use the sync locale feature. Make your changes to the primary locale instead.
Use sync locales
You control the sync locales feature with an opt-in toggle that's made available in the developer console on the Language Settings page.

After you opt in, you choose a primary locale and a set of secondary locales from the menu made available in the developer console on the Language Settings page. When the sync locales feature triggers, it automatically copies your primary locale to the secondary locales you have selected.

Sync locales runs in the background so you can continue to make updates to your skill. Due to this, sync locales might overwrite any manual updates that you have made to your secondary locale. If you want to make specific changes to your locale, opt out of the sync locales process. For more details about how to control opt-in and opt-out settings, see Use sync locales.

 Note: For best results, don't use sync locales with skills that are already using automated locale distribution. In addition, don't try to delete your skill or submit your skill for certification while the sync locales sync is in progress.
